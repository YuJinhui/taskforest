It uses text config files to\r\nspecify task dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Executive Summary \r\n\r\nWith the TaskForest Job Scheduler you can:\r\n\r\n- schedule jobs run at predetermined times\r\n- have jobs be dependent on each other\r\n- rerun failed jobs\r\n- mark jobs as succeeded or failed\r\n- put jobs on hold and release the holds\r\n- release all dependencies on a job\r\n- check the status of all jobs scheduled to run today\r\n- interact with the included web service using your own client code\r\n- interact with the included web server using your default browser\r\n- express the relationships between jobs using a simple text-based format (a big advantage if you like using 'grep')\r\n\r\n### Synopsis\r\n\r\nOver the years TaskForest has migrated from a collection of simple perl\r\nmodules to a full-fledged system. I have found that putting the\r\ndocumentation in a single POD is getting much more difficult. You can\r\nnow find the latest documetation on the TaskForest website located at [taskforest.com](http://www.taskforest.com/). If you run the included web server, you will also find a complete copy\r\nof the documentation on the included web site.\r\n\r\n### Support \r\n\r\nFor support, please visit our website at http://www.taskforest.com/ or\r\ncreate an issue on GitHub\r\n\r\n### Authors\r\n\r\n[Aijaz A. Ansari](http://aijaz.net/)\r\n\r\nThe following developers have graciously contributed patches to enhance TaskForest:\r\n\r\n-  Steve Hulet\r\n\r\nPlease see the 'Changes' file for details. If you have contributed code,\r\nand your name is not on the above list, please accept my apologies and\r\nlet me know, so that I may give you credit.\r\nIf you're using this program, I would love to hear from you.

Schwartz for teaching the readers\r\nof the Feb 1999 issue of Web Techniques how to write a pre-forking web\r\nserver, the code upon which the TaskForest Web server is built.\r\n\r\nI would also like to thank the fine developers at Yahoo! for providing\r\nyui to the open source community.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nTaskForest is available under the Apache License.

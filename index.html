<p><strong>TaskForest</strong> is a simple but expressive job scheduler that allows you to
chain jobs/tasks and create time dependencies. It uses text config files to
specify task dependencies.</p>

<h3>
<a id="executive-summary" class="anchor" href="#executive-summary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Executive Summary</h3>

<p>With the TaskForest Job Scheduler you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>schedule jobs run at predetermined times</li>
<li>have jobs be dependent on each other</li>
<li>rerun failed jobs</li>
<li>mark jobs as succeeded or failed</li>
<li>put jobs on hold and release the holds</li>
<li>release all dependencies on a job</li>
<li>automatically rerun jobs that fail</li>
<li>receive custom emails or SMS when jobs fail, are retried, or succeed</li>
<li>check the status of all jobs scheduled to run today</li>
<li>interact with the included web service using your own client code</li>
<li>interact with the included web server using your default browser</li>
<li>express the relationships between jobs using a simple text-based format (a big advantage if you like using 'grep')</li>
<li>browse job logs using the included web server</li>
</ul>

<p>A Job Scheduler is an application that is responsible for scheduling and running programs (also known as jobs or tasks). The user specifies dependencies between jobs, and the job scheduler runs each job only after all its dependencies have been met. Dependencies may be the successful completion of another job (the prerequisite job), or a certain time of day, or ownership of a limited resource or token.</p>

<p>The job scheduler is also responsible for allowing the operator to rerun failed (or even successful) jobs, mark jobs as having succeeded or failed, and querying the status of all the jobs that are scheduled to run.</p>

<p>Collections of jobs that are dependent on each other are known as Families. Some schedulers call Families "Job Streams."</p>

<h3>
<a id="taskforest-design-philosophy" class="anchor" href="#taskforest-design-philosophy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TaskForest Design Philosophy</h3>

<p>The TaskForest Job Scheduler is designed with the philosophy that a program should be no more complicated than the minimum amount required to achieve its objectives. Complicated functions can be achieved by a conjunction of simpler functions.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, TaskForest has been designed to run as a single command that, once invoked from the command line, launches any jobs that need to be run, and then sleeps for a bit and then tries again. If you want, the taskforest script can also exit and be run repeatedly. It is a stateless application. You could launch taskforest once a day, and have it run all day, or you could run it once every minute (for example) using cron.</p>

<p>Since TaskForest does not need any graphical interface, it can be run on headless servers that don't have X installed. If you would prefer a graphical interface, it also comes with its own web server so that you can administer the application using any standard web browser. We also provide you a RESTful API that allow you to write your own web clients, so that you can control TaskForest from within your program. Everything you need to do to configure the system can be done by editing text files. </p>

<a id="why-text-files-are-a-good-idea" class="anchor" href="#why-text-files-are-a-good-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Text Files are a Good Idea</h3>

<p>One of the initial design requirements of TaskForest was that it be easily configuriable with just a shell prompt and your favorite text editor. Many of the servers I administer are old boxes which I administer by logging into them via ssh. So when it came to designing job dependencies in Family files, I chose a text file representation. The benefits of text files over a graphical user interface for this are many:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Easy Remote Access</strong> - All you need is the ability to get to a command line and a text editor on the machine that runs taskforest. With the such low client access requirements, virtually any old machine that has internet access and an ssh client can be used to administer the system. I have often worked on our taskforestd server from a local internet cafe using a Putty.exe downloaded minutes earlier.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile Access</strong> - Text files also make work relatively easy using a mobile ssh client like Idokorro Mobile SSH. A dedicated mobile client would be ideal, but short of that, the text file approach assures low bandwidth usage and easy-to-make changes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Flexibility</strong> - The simple, easily parseable format of text files allows us to build richer clients later that would use a graphical interface to specify relationships between jobs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Source Control</strong> - The text based format makes it easy to place the Family files under source control. You can also easily diff different versions of the same family file.</li>
<li>
<strong>Grep</strong> - When you have dozens of family files and hundreds of jobs, you may need to answer questions like: "Are we still running Job J1? It needs to be decommissioned." This can easily be answered by grepping the Family files for job J1.</li>
</ul>

<a id="comparing-taskforest-to-cron" class="anchor" href="#comparing-taskforest-to-cron" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Comparing TaskForest to cron</h3>

<p>Cron is a very powerful tool, but lacks some important features that most job schedulers perform: It's not easy to specify complex dependencies between jobs. It's also not possible to use cron to rerun jobs or mark jobs as having succeeded so that dependent jobs may run.</p>

<h2>
<a id="installing-taskforest" class="anchor" href="#installing-taskforest" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing TaskForest</h2>

<p>This program depends on DateTime, for timezone support. You can install DateTime as follows:</p>

<pre><code>perl -MCPAN -e 'install DateTime'
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, as of version 1.10, it also depends on Config::General and Log::Log4perl. You can install these as follows:</p>

<pre><code>perl -MCPAN -e 'install Config::General'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Log::Log4perl'
</code></pre>

<p>As of version 1.15, it also depends on the LWP libraries such as HTTP::Daemon, HTTP::Request, etc.</p>

<p>Download the latest TaskForest repository. You can install it the 'normal' way:</p>

<pre><code>cd taskforest
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
If you don't have root access, and want to install in a local directory like ~/perl, replace the third line with
</code></pre>

<pre><code>perl Makefile.PL prefix=~/perl
</code></pre>

<a id="configuring-taskforest" class="anchor" href="#configuring-taskforest" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuring TaskForest</h2>

<p>There are two main parts to configuring TaskForest: configuring the Family files that specify job dependencies, and setting the options that determine TaskForest's behavior.</p>

<h3>
<a id="precedence-of-different-options-sources" class="anchor" href="#precedence-of-different-options-sources" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Precedence of Different Options Sources</h3>

<p>All settings (required and optional) may be specified in a variety of ways: command line, environment variable and config file. The order of preferences is this: Most options have default values. Settings specified in the config file override those defaults. Settings specified in environment variables take override those specified in the config file and the default values. Setting specified on the command line override those specified in envrionment variables, and those specified in the config files and the default values.</p>

<p>The names of the environment variable are the same as the names of the settings on the command line (or in the config file), but they should be in UPPER CASE, with <code>TF_</code> prepended. For example, the environment variable name for the <code>run_wrapper</code> setting is <code>TF_RUN_WRAPPER</code>.</p>

<p><strong>TaskForest</strong> is a simple but expressive job scheduler that allows you to
chain jobs/tasks and create time dependencies. It uses text config files to
specify task dependencies.</p>

<p>A Job Scheduler is an application that is responsible for scheduling and running programs (also known as jobs or tasks). The user specifies dependencies between jobs, and the job scheduler runs each job only after all its dependencies have been met. Dependencies may be the successful completion of another job (the prerequisite job), or a certain time of day, or ownership of a limited resource or token.</p>

<p>The job scheduler is also responsible for allowing the operator to rerun failed (or even successful) jobs, mark jobs as having succeeded or failed, and querying the status of all the jobs that are scheduled to run.</p>

<p>Collections of jobs that are dependent on each other are known as Families. Some schedulers call Families "Job Streams."</p>

<h3>
<a id="taskforest-design-philosophy" class="anchor" href="#taskforest-design-philosophy" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>TaskForest Design Philosophy</h3>

<p>The TaskForest Job Scheduler is designed with the philosophy that a program should be no more complicated than the minimum amount required to achieve its objectives. Complicated functions can be achieved by a conjunction of simpler functions.</p>

<p>To illustrate this, TaskForest has been designed to run as a single command that, once invoked from the command line, launches any jobs that need to be run, and then sleeps for a bit and then tries again. If you want, the taskforest script can also exit and be run repeatedly. It is a stateless application. You could launch taskforest once a day, and have it run all day, or you could run it once every minute (for example) using cron.</p>

<p>Since TaskForest does not need any graphical interface, it can be run on headless servers that don't have X installed. If you would prefer a graphical interface, it also comes with its own web server so that you can administer the application using any standard web browser. We also provide you a RESTful API that allow you to write your own web clients, so that you can control TaskForest from within your program. Everything you need to do to configure the system can be done by editing text files. </p>

<a id="why-text-files-are-a-good-idea" class="anchor" href="#why-text-files-are-a-good-idea" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a name="text_files"></a>Why Text Files are a Good Idea</h3>

<p>One of the initial design requirements of TaskForest was that it be easily configuriable with just a shell prompt and your favorite text editor. Many of the servers I administer are old boxes which I administer by logging into them via ssh. So when it came to designing job dependencies in Family files, I chose a text file representation. The benefits of text files over a graphical user interface for this are many:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Easy Remote Access</strong> - All you need is the ability to get to a command line and a text editor on the machine that runs taskforest. With the such low client access requirements, virtually any old machine that has internet access and an ssh client can be used to administer the system. I have often worked on our taskforestd server from a local internet cafe using a Putty.exe downloaded minutes earlier.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mobile Access</strong> - Text files also make work relatively easy using a mobile ssh client like Idokorro Mobile SSH. A dedicated mobile client would be ideal, but short of that, the text file approach assures low bandwidth usage and easy-to-make changes.</li>
<li>
<strong>Flexibility</strong> - The simple, easily parseable format of text files allows us to build richer clients later that would use a graphical interface to specify relationships between jobs.</li>
<li>
<strong>Source Control</strong> - The text based format makes it easy to place the Family files under source control. You can also easily diff different versions of the same family file.</li>
<li>
<strong>Grep</strong> - When you have dozens of family files and hundreds of jobs, you may need to answer questions like: "Are we still running Job J1? It needs to be decommissioned." This can easily be answered by grepping the Family files for job J1.</li>
</ul>

<a id="comparing-taskforest-to-cron" class="anchor" href="#comparing-taskforest-to-cron" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Comparing TaskForest to cron</h3>

<p>Cron is a very powerful tool, but lacks some important features that most job schedulers perform: It's not easy to specify complex dependencies between jobs. It's also not possible to use cron to rerun jobs or mark jobs as having succeeded so that dependent jobs may run.</p>

<a id="installing-taskforest" class="anchor" href="#installing-taskforest" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installing TaskForest</h2>

<p>This program depends on DateTime, for timezone support. You can install DateTime as follows:</p>

<pre><code>perl -MCPAN -e 'install DateTime'
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, as of version 1.10, it also depends on Config::General and Log::Log4perl. You can install these as follows:</p>

<pre><code>perl -MCPAN -e 'install Config::General'
perl -MCPAN -e 'install Log::Log4perl'
</code></pre>

<p>As of version 1.15, it also depends on the LWP libraries such as HTTP::Daemon, HTTP::Request, etc.</p>

<p>Download the latest TaskForest repository. You can install it the 'normal' way:</p>

<pre><code>cd taskforest
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
</code></pre>

<p>If you don't have root access, and want to install in a local directory like ~/perl, replace the third line with</p>

<pre><code>perl Makefile.PL prefix=~/perl
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="configuring-taskforest" class="anchor" href="#configuring-taskforest" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Configuring TaskForest</h2>

<p>There are two main parts to configuring TaskForest: configuring the Family files that specify job dependencies, and setting the options that determine TaskForest's behavior.</p>

<h3>
<a id="precedence-of-different-options-sources" class="anchor" href="#precedence-of-different-options-sources" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Precedence of Different Options Sources</h3>

<p>All settings (required and optional) may be specified in a variety of ways: command line, environment variable and config file. The order of preferences is this: Most options have default values. Settings specified in the config file override those defaults. Settings specified in environment variables take override those specified in the config file and the default values. Setting specified on the command line override those specified in envrionment variables, and those specified in the config files and the default values.</p>

<p>The names of the environment variable are the same as the names of the settings on the command line (or in the config file), but they should be in UPPER CASE, with <code>TF_</code> prepended. For example, the environment variable name for the [run_wrapper][] setting is <code>TF_RUN_WRAPPER</code>.</p>

<h2>
<a id="jobs" class="anchor" href="#jobs" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Jobs</h2>

<p>A job is defined as any executable program that resides on the file system. It is represented as a file in the files system whose name is the same as the job name. Jobs can depend on each other. Jobs can also have start times before which a job may not by run.</p>

<p>When a job is run by the run wrapper (<code>bin/run_with_log</code>), two status semaphore files are created in the [log directory][]. The first is created when a job starts and has a name of <code>$FamilyName.$JobName.pid</code>. This file contains some attributes of the job. When the job completes, more attributes are written to this file.</p>

<p>When the job completes, another semaphore file is written to the [log directory][]. The name of this file will be <code>$FamilyName.$JobName.0</code> if the job ran successfully, and <code>$FamilyName.$JobName.1</code> if the job failed. In either case, the file will contain the exit code of the job (0 in the case of success and non-zero otherwise).</p>

<p>When a job is run by the <code>run_with_log</code> run wrapper, any output the job sends to stdout or stderr will be captured and stored in a file called <code>$FamilyName.$JobName.$pid.$start_time.stdout</code> in the [log directory][].</p>

<h2>
<a id="job-status" class="anchor" href="#job-status" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Job Status</h2>

<p>Within TaskForest, every job has a status, which is one of the following values:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Waiting</strong> - One or more dependencies of the job have not been met.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ready</strong> - All dependencies have been met; the job will run during the next iteration of the taskforest [main loop][].</li>
<li>
<strong>Running</strong> - The job is currently running</li>
<li>
<strong>Success</strong> - The job has run successfully</li>
<li>
<strong>Failure</strong> - The job was run, but the program exited with a non-zero return code</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="families" class="anchor" href="#families" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Families</h2>

<p>Jobs can be grouped together into <strong>families</strong>. A family has a start time associated with it before which none of its jobs may run. A family also has a either (a) a list of days-of-the-week or (b) a calendar associated with it. Jobs within a family may only run on the days specified by the days-of-the-week or the calendar.</p>

<p>Jobs and families are given simple names. A family is described in a family file whose name is the family name. Each family file is a text file that contains 1 or more job names. The layout of the job names within a family file determine the dependencies between the jobs (if any). There are [several reasons why text files are a good choice for Family files][].</p>

<p>Family names and job names should contain only the following characters:
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_</p>

<p>Let's see a few examples. The main script expects environment variables or command line options or configuration file settings that specify the locations of the directory that contain family files, the directory that contains job files, and the directory where the logs will be written. The directory that contains family files should contain only family files.</p>

<h4>
<a id="example-1---family-file-named-f_admin" class="anchor" href="#example-1---family-file-named-f_admin" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>EXAMPLE 1 - Family file named F_ADMIN</h4>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', days =&gt; 'Mon,Wed,Fri'

 J_ROTATE_LOGS()
</code></pre>

<p>The first line in any family file always contains 3 bits of information about the family: the start time, the time zone, and the days on which this jobs in this family are run, or the calendar that specifies on which dates jobs in this family are run.</p>

<p>In this case, this family starts at 2:00 a.m. Chicago time. The time is adjusted for daylight savings time. This family 'runs' on Monday, Wednesday and Friday only. Pay attention to the format: it's important.</p>

<p>Valid days are 'Mon', 'Tue', 'Wed', 'Thu', 'Fri', 'Sat', 'Sun'. Days must be separated by commas.</p>

<p>All start times (for families and jobs) are in 24-hour format. '00:00' is midnight, '12:00' is noon, '13:00' is 1:00 p.m. and '23:59' is one minute before midnight.</p>

<p>There is only one job in this family - J_ROTATE_LOGS. This family will start at 2:00 a.m., at which time J_ROTATE_LOGS will immediately be run. Note the empty parentheses [()]. These are required.</p>

<p>What does it mean to say that J_ROTATE_LOGS will be run? It means that the system will look for a file called J_ROTATE_LOGS in the directory that contains job files. That file should be executable. The system will execute that file (run that job) and keep track of whether it succeeded or failed. The J_ROTATE_LOGS script can be any executable file: a shell script, a perl script, a C program etc.</p>

<p>To run the program, the system actually runs a wrapper script that invokes the job script. The location of the wrapper script is specified on the command line or in an environment variable.</p>

<p>Now, let's look at a slightly more complicated example:</p>

<h4>
<a id="example-2---job-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#example-2---job-dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>EXAMPLE 2 - Job Dependencies</h4>

<p>This family file is named WEB_ADMIN.</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'Weekdays'

               J_ROTATE_LOGS()

 J_RESOLVE_DNS()       Delete_Old_Logs()

               J_WEB_REPORTS()      

    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification
</code></pre>

<p>A few things to point out here:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blank lines are ignored.</li>
<li>A hash (#) and anything after it, until the end of the line is treated as a comment and ignored.</li>
<li>Job and family names do not have to start with J_ or be in upper case.</li>
<li>Instead of specifying days of the week on which this Family may run, this Family specifies a calendar to which it adheres. The calendar used in this case is called 'Weekdays.' For a detailed description of calendars, please see the [calendars][] documentation.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is possible to have a dependency on a job that's in another family. If, for example, J_ROTATE_LOGS was in the Family named LOGS, then the family above would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'Weekdays'

            LOGS::J_ROTATE_LOGS()

 J_RESOLVE_DNS()       Delete_Old_Logs()

               J_WEB_REPORTS()      

    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification
</code></pre>

<p>An external job dependency is different from 'normal' job dependencies, because unlike 'normal' dependencies, it specifies only the dependency, and not when the external job should run. This means that looking at the above family file, we cannot say when J_ROTATE_LOGS will run. More accurately, we cannot say when LOGS::J_ROTATE_LOGS will run. All we know is that after it runs, J_RESOLVE_DNS and Delete_Old_Logs can run (after 2:00 GMT).</p>

<p>This also means that external job dependencies may only be specified on the first line of a Family, or the first line of a group of jobs (see example 4). Therefore the following is not allowed:</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'Weekdays'

            LOGS::J_ROTATE_LOGS()

 J_RESOLVE_DNS()       Delete_Old_Logs()

            REPORTS::J_WEB_REPORTS()  # BAD!

    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification
</code></pre>

<p>To see how this should be written, we need to know about Job Forests. Since that's described in example 4, we'll defer the solution until then.</p>

<p>One last thing about external job dependencies: just because we're waiting on a job in another family, that doesn't mean that the same job cannot be run in this family. For example, the following is permitted:</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'Weekdays'

            LOGS::J_ROTATE_LOGS()

 J_RESOLVE_DNS()       Delete_Old_Logs()

               J_WEB_REPORTS()

    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification

                J_ROTATE_LOGS()   # This is a different
                                  # job!
</code></pre>

<p>The family will not start until J_ROTATE_LOGS has run from the LOGS family. The last job run by this family will be J_ROTATE_LOGS. It has nothing to do with the instance of the job that ran in the LOGS family. Line 11 will actually run the job, while line 3 only checks whether the job has run (by another family). That's what I mean when I say that external dependencies only specify the dependencies, while normal dependencies also specify when the job should run.</p>

<h4>
<a id="example-3---time-dependencies" class="anchor" href="#example-3---time-dependencies" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>EXAMPLE 3 - Time Dependencies</h4>

<p>Let's say that we don't want J_RESOLVE_DNS to start before 9:00 a.m. because it's very IO-intensive and we want to wait until the relatively quiet time of 9:00 a.m. In that case, we can put a time dependency of the job. This adds a restriction to the job, saying that it may not run before the time specified. We would do this as follows:</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'Weekdays'

               J_ROTATE_LOGS()

 J_RESOLVE_DNS(start =&gt; '09:00')  Delete_Old_Logs()

               J_WEB_REPORTS()      

    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification
</code></pre>

<p>J_ROTATE_LOGS will still start at 2:00, as always. As soon as it succeeds, Delete_Old_Logs is started. If J_ROTATE_LOGS succeeds before 09:00, the system will wait until 09:00 before starting J_RESOLVE_DNS. It is possible that Delete_Old_Logs would have started and complete by then. J_WEB_REPORTS would not have started in that case, because it is dependent on two jobs, and both of them have to run successfully before it can run.</p>

<p>For completeness, you may also specify a timezone for a job's time dependency as follows:</p>

<pre><code>J_RESOLVE_DNS(start=&gt;'10:00', tz=&gt;'America/New_York') ...
</code></pre>

<h4>
<a id="example-4---job-forests" class="anchor" href="#example-4---job-forests" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>EXAMPLE 4 - Job Forests</h4>

<p>You can see in the example above that line 03 is the start of a group of dependent jobs. No job on any other line can start unless the job on line 03 succeeds. What if you wanted two or more groups of jobs in the same family that start at the same time (barring any time dependencies) and proceed independently of each other?</p>

<p>To do this you would separate the groups with a line containing one or more dashes (only). Consider the following family:</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'Weekdays'

               J_ROTATE_LOGS()

 J_RESOLVE_DNS(start =&gt; '09:00')    Delete_Old_Logs()

               J_WEB_REPORTS()      

    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification

-------------------------------------------------------

 J_UPDATE_ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE()

 J_ATTEMPT_CREDIT_CARD_PAYMENTS()

-------------------------------------------------------

 J_SEND_EXPIRING_CARDS_EMAIL()

</code></pre>

<p>Because of the lines of dashes on lines 11 and 17, the jobs on lines 03, 13 and 19 will all start at 02:00. These jobs are independent of each other. J_ATTEMPT_CREDIT_CARD_PAYMENT will not run if J_UPDATE_ACCOUNTS_RECEIVABLE fails. That failure, however will not prevent J_SEND_EXPIRING_CARDS_EMAIL from running.</p>

<p>Finally, you can specify a job to run repeatedly every 'n' minutes, as follows:</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'Weekdays'

 J_CHECK_DISK_USAGE(every=&gt;'30', until=&gt;'23:00')
</code></pre>

<p>This means that J_CHECK_DISK_USAGE will be called every 30 minutes and will not run on or after 23:00. By default, the 'until' time is 23:59. If the job starts at 02:00 and takes 25 minutes to run to completion, the next occurance will still start at 02:30, and not at 02:55. By default, every repeat occurrance will only have one dependency - the time - and will not depend on earlier occurances running successfully or even running at all. If line 03 were:</p>

<pre><code>J_CHECK_DISK_USAGE(every=&gt;'30', until=&gt;'23:00', chained=&gt;1)
</code></pre>

<p>...then each repeat job will be dependent on the previous occurance.</p>

<p>Now, let's get back to our discussion of external dependencies from example 3. I said that an external dependency may only be specified on the first line of the file or the first line of a group of jobs. This way of specifying a family is not allowed by TaskForest:</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'Weekdays'

            LOGS::J_ROTATE_LOGS()

 J_RESOLVE_DNS()       Delete_Old_Logs()

            REPORTS::J_WEB_REPORTS()  # BAD!

    J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification
</code></pre>

<p>With a few minor modifications, the family can be specified correctly:</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '02:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'Weekdays'

            LOGS::J_ROTATE_LOGS()

 J_RESOLVE_DNS()       Delete_Old_Logs()

--------------------------------------------

 J_RESOLVE_DNS() Delete_Old_Logs() REPORTS::J_WEB_REPORTS()

   J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE()  # send me a notification
</code></pre>

<p>We've moved the external dependency to the first line of it's own section. Now J_EMAIL_WEB_RPT_DONE relies on all 3 jobs, 2 that run in this Family, and one from the REPORTS family.</p>

<h2>
<a id="tokens" class="anchor" href="#tokens" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tokens</h2>

<p>A token is a dependency. It is something that a job must 'possess' before it can run, if that job needs that token. You can create different types of tokens, giving each type a common name. You can also specify how many instances of tokens of each type are to exist. For example, if the configuration file contained the following lines:</p>

<pre><code> ...   
 &lt;token T&gt;
   number = 1
 &lt;/token&gt;
 &lt;token U&gt;
   number = 2
 &lt;/token&gt;
 ...
</code></pre>

<p>...it means that there are two types of tokens: 'T' and 'U'. There is only one instance of token type 'T', and two of type 'U'.</p>

<p>Given the above configuration, if your Family file looked as follows:</p>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '00:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', days =&gt; 'Mon,Wed,Fri'

 J1( token =&gt; 'T')  J2 ( token =&gt; 'T' ) J3()

-------------------------------------------------------

 J6(token =&gt; 'U') J5(token =&gt; 'U') J4(token =&gt; 'U')
 J8(token =&gt; 'T,U')

</code></pre>

<p>...then that means that job J1 and J2 both need a token of type 'T' to run. But, there's only one instance of token T, so J1 and J2 cannot both run at the same time (even though they would, if they didn't rely on tokens). The system will sort jobs alphabetically by name and choose the first in the list. In other words, in this case, J1 will run first and J2 will only run after J1 completes (if no other job has taken the token first). To be more accurate, J1 and J3 will run simultaneously, since J3 does not need any tokens.</p>

<p>To be even more accurate, J1, J3, J4 and J5 will run simultaneously. This is because J4, J5 and J6 all rely on token U, but there are only 2 instances of token U. Even though J6 appears on the line before J5 and J4, the system will choose J4 and J5 first, because they appear first in alphabetical order, and J6 will run after one of the other two have completed.</p>

<p>Because the system always chooses the job with the smallest name (alphabetically), it is possible to experience 'resource starvation' - where a job with a 'larger' name could never get an opportunity to run, because there are too many other jobs with smaller names that get to run first by virtue of their names. Future versions of TaskForest will implement heuristics to prevent resource starvations.</p>

<p>Note that J8 relies on two tokens: T and U. It will only run when it can acquire one of both tokens. If it can acquire one, but not the other, it will release the first and try to acquire both at a later time.</p>

<p>Finally, tokens can also be used to control the load on the machine on which taskforest is running. If you've got several independent jobs that don't depend on each other, but which use a fair amount of resources, you can have all the jobs use the same token. Then you can tweak the maximum number of instances of that token to a value that maximizes the number of simultaneous jobs without putting too much strain on the server.</p>

<h2>
<a id="-calendars" class="anchor" href="#-calendars" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><a name="calendars"></a> Calendars</h2>

<p>A calendar is a set of rules that defines on what days a job may run. The rules that make up a calendar are specified in the configuration file and the calendars themselves are associated with a Family in the Family file.</p>

<p>Calendar names should contain only the characters shown below:
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789_.-</p>

<p>Let's start with the configuration file. You can have zero or more calendars in the configuration file. Each calendar may be associated with zero or more Families. A calendar consists of one or more rules. All rules belonging to a calendar are consulted in order to determine whether or not the Family should run today. The rules are consulted in the order in which they are specified in the configuration file. Rules may contradict each other. A rule may not conclusively determine whether or not the Family should run today. The last rule that determines whether or not a Family should run today will override any earlier rules. Rules are case insensitive.</p>

<p>Let's see some examples. First, let's see how a Family file specifies a calendar:</p>

<h4>
<a id="example-one-day-only" class="anchor" href="#example-one-day-only" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example: One day only</h4>

<pre><code>start =&gt; '00:00', tz =&gt; 'GMT', calendar =&gt; 'NY2010'

 ...
</code></pre>

<p>You can see here that instead of the <code>days =&gt; '...'</code>, we have <code>calendar =&gt; 'NY2010'</code>. This tells the system that this family will rely on the calendar named <code>NY2010</code>. This calendar is defined in its own file. The file name should be the same as the calendar name. The directory in which the file exists is specified by the [calendar_dir][] option:</p>

<pre><code>...
calendar_dir = "/foo/bar/calendars"
...
</code></pre>

<p>The file /foo/bar/calendars/NY2010 looks like this (the # symbols and anything after them are comments, just like in the [configuration file][]):</p>

<pre><code># NY2010
+ 2010/01/01  # Only valid on New Years Day, 2010
</code></pre>

<p>This calendar only has one rule. It is "+ 2010/01/01". The '+' in the rule says that if the date specified in this rule matches, then the Family must run on that day. The '+' is optional. This calendar will allow the Family that uses it to run on Jan 1, 2010, and on no other day. Dates in rules should be in the YYYY/MM/DD format.</p>

<h4>
<a id="example-one-month-only" class="anchor" href="#example-one-month-only" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example: One month only</h4>

<p>What if we want a job to run on every day in November 2010? You can use a rule like this:</p>

<pre><code># Nov2010

2010/11/*
</code></pre>

<p>The '*' in the DD part of the date is like a wildcard. It means that the DD part of the rule will match any number. In other words, if today's date is November DD, 2010, then this rule will match, for all values of DD. Note that the '+' is missing here. That's ok. It's optional, and if missing, the system will assume that you meant to put in a '+'.</p>

<h4>
<a id="example-rejecting-days" class="anchor" href="#example-rejecting-days" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example: Rejecting days</h4>

<p>If, on the other hand, you wanted this Families that use this calendar to run on all days in 2010 except all of November, you would use the '-' sign:</p>

<pre><code># All_But_Nov2010

 + 2010/*/*
 - 2010/11/*
</code></pre>

<p>The first line matches all days in 2010. The MM and DD parts are both wildcards. The optional plus tells the system that if the date matches this pattern, it should count as a valid run date. The next line, on the other, hand adds an exception to this rule: If the date falls within November 2010, the date should not be a valid run date - note the '-' sign that tells the system to exclude this date.</p>

<h4>
<a id="example-daily-calendar" class="anchor" href="#example-daily-calendar" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example: Daily Calendar</h4>

<p>To specify a daily calendar, use this:</p>

<pre><code># Daily

*/*/*
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you don't have to name the calendar 'Daily.' You can name it whatever you want. Using this calendar is equivalent to having <code>days=&gt;'Mon,Tue,Wed,Thu,Fri,Sat,Sun'</code> in the Family file.</p>

<h4>
<a id="example-specifying-days-of-the-week" class="anchor" href="#example-specifying-days-of-the-week" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Example: Specifying days of the week</h4>

<p>You can also specify rules that specify days of the week with a qualifier. For example, to run a job on the first Monday of every month in 2009, you should use a rule like this:</p>

<pre><code># FirstMon09

+ first Mon 2009/*
</code></pre>

<p>A couple of points to mention here: First, the '+' is optional here as well. Second, the date part of the rule only has the year and the month (in YYYY/MM format). When you use a qualifier like 'first,' it makes no sense to say things like 'The first Monday of the 1st of every month.'</p>

<p>The word 'first' in line 2 above is called a qualifier. Valid qualifiers are:</p>

<ul>
<li>first</li>
<li>second</li>
<li>third</li>
<li>fourth</li>
<li>fifth</li>
<li>last</li>
<li>second last</li>
<li>third last</li>
<li>fourth last</li>
<li>every</li>
</ul>

<p>The qualifiers 'first last,', 'last last' and 'every last' also work in version 1.25, but they may stop working in a future version, so don't get into the habit of using those qualifiers.</p>

<p>Unlike the 'days' specifier in the family file, the days of the week in calendar rules may be spelled out. Only the first 3 characters are significant.</p>

<h4>
<a id="calendar-recipes" class="anchor" href="#calendar-recipes" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Calendar Recipes</h4>

<p>The following 'recipes' show you some useful calendar rules:</p>

<pre><code># ############################################################
# Run every day
#
+ */*/*
</code></pre>

<pre><code># ############################################################
# Run on weekdays only
#
*/*/*
- every Saturday */*
- every Sunday */*

# You could also replace the 3 lines above
# with 5 '+' lines, one for each weekday.
</code></pre>

<pre><code># ############################################################

#

</code></pre>

<pre><code># ############################################################

</code></pre>

</code></pre>

<h2>
<a id="automatic-retries" class="anchor" href="#automatic-retries" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Automatic Retries</h2>

<p>TaskForest can be configured so that when a job fails, it will automatically retry running the job. There is a system-wide option called [num_retries][] that specifies how many times the job will be retried. The [retry_sleep][] option specifies how many seconds the system will wait before trying to rerun the job.</p>

<p>The [num_retries][] and [retry_sleep][] options may optionally be specified for each job as well. For example, if the configuration file contains this...</p>

<pre><code># This is the number of times to automatically
# retry running a job that fails 
[num_retries](num_retries)              = 1

# Wait these many seconds before automatically
# retrying running a job that fails 
retry_sleep              = 300
</code></pre>

<p>...then if any job fails, the run wrapper will sleep for 300 seconds and then retry the job once. If the retry fails as well, then the job will be considered to have failed. If the retry succeeds, then job will have considered to have run successfully. During 300 second sleep period, and during the retries, the official status of the job will still be 'Running.'</p>

<p>The responsibility of implementing the auto-retries falls on the run wrapper. Even though TaskForest ships with two run wrappers, you really should use run_with_log and not run. When a job is being retried, run_with_log will note it the log file like this:</p>

<pre><code>*****************************************************************

*****************************************************************
</code></pre>

<p>You can see that in this case, TaskForest had been instructed to sleep for 2 seconds before retrying, and that there was to be only one retry.</p>

<p>You can also override these configuration settings for individual jobs. Let's say you have your configuration file set up as shown above, with one retry after 300 seconds. Now suppose you want job J_Retry to be retried 10 times, with a two-minute sleep between retries. You could specify the overrides directly in the family file as follows:</p>

<pre><code>...
J_Retry (num_retries =&gt; 10, retry_sleep =&gt; 120)
...
</code></pre>

<p>This local specification of ten retries spaced two minutes apart will override what you have specified in the configuration file. You can override these configuration options on as many jobs as you wish.</p>

<h2>
<a id="emails" class="anchor" href="#emails" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Emails</h2>

<p>You can configure TaskForest to send you an email or SMS message (text) in any of these three situations:</p>

<ul>
<li>When a job fails</li>
<li>When a job fails but will be automatically retried</li>
<li>When a job that failed and was automatically retried finally succeeds</li>
</ul>

<p>You can configure this feature system-wide via the configuration file, and you can also override it for individual jobs in the Family files (the same way retries are configured). You can also completely configure the emails or texts going out in each of the three cases, from the SMTP envelope information to MIME headers to body text. Again, this can be configured across the entire system and overridden for individual jobs and families. It really is a very powerful system that, with the proper email filters, can make managing your job workflow very easy. Let's see how it works.</p>

<p>In order to be able to send emails, you need to provide TaskForest some information in the configuration file:</p>

<pre><code># This is the SMTP server that will be used to send 
# emails out when a job fails, for example
smtp_server              = "localhost"

# The default SMTP port is 25.
smtp_port                = 25

# In a production environment this should be 60 or 120
smtp_timeout             = 60

# This is the SMTP envelope sender 
# (the text after "MAIL FROM:")
smtp_sender                = "user1@example.com"

# This is the email address that appears in the From: 
# mail header
mail_from                = "user1@example.com"

# If a user replies to a received email, the reply
# will go to this address instead of the From: address. 
# This address is set in the Reply-To mail header.
mail_reply_to            = "user2@example.com"

# This is the address to which bounces will be sent if 
# they occur at the SMTP server (as opposed to the 
# receiving Mail Transfer Agent).
mail_return_path         = "user3@example.com"

# This is the directory that stores the contents of
# the emails that are sent by the system. 
instructions_dir         = "instructions"
</code></pre>

<p>Then there are the following three settings that control who receives the emails. They can be set system-wide in the configuration file:</p>

<div class="highlight highlight-source-python"><pre><span class="pl-c"># When a job fails, emails are sent to this address</span>
email                    <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>test@example.com<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>

<span class="pl-c"># When a job fails, but is being automatically retried,</span>
<span class="pl-c"># emails are sent to this address, as opposed to the </span>
<span class="pl-c"># one stored in the 'email' setting.  If no_retry_mail </span>
<span class="pl-c"># is set, then no email will be sent in this case</span>
retry_email              <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>test2@example.com<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>

<span class="pl-c"># When a job fails, is automatically retried one or more </span>
<span class="pl-c"># times and then suceededs, emails are sent to this </span>
<span class="pl-c"># address, as opposed to any of the others.  If </span>
<span class="pl-c"># no_retry_success_email is set, then no email will be sent</span>
<span class="pl-c"># in this case.</span>
[retry_success_email][]      <span class="pl-k">=</span> <span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>test3@example.com<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span></pre></div>

<p>Given the setup shown above, the email generated when a job is being retried is shown below. What you see below is a transcript of a SMTP session between TaskForest and a fake SMTP server used for testing. Lines that start with 'S: &gt;' denote text sent from the SMTP server to the client (TaskForest). Lines that start with 'C: &lt;' denote text sent from the SMTP client (TaskForest) to the SMTP server.</p>
